# Algorithm and Data Structure

## Algorithm

### Algorithm Complexity

**Space Complexity:** the amount of memory the program requires.

**Time Complexity:** time it takes to complete.  

All of these are judged by a defined set of input and output.  

### Common Big-O Terms

- Performance of the algorithm as the input size grows  
- "O" means the order of operation: time scale or memory scale to perform an operation
- Worst case scenario

Particularly, we have by ascending order of time complexity:

  1. O(1)  
  2. O(log n)
  3. O(n)
  4. O(n log n): heap sort and merge sort
  5. O(n^2): bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort
  6. O(n!)

## Data Structure

### Common Data Structure

- Arrays: collection of elements, one or multi-dimensional.
- Linked lists: linear collection of nodes.
- Stacks and queues
- Trees
- Hash tables
- Graph
